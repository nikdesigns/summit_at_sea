          The 145 Summit at Sea
          <strong>(hereafter SAS) </strong> Trade Show Exhibit is a networking
          opportunity for shops and airlines to meet and explore potential
          <strong>business opportunities.</strong>. The following information is
          to serve as a guideline for your participation during this event. Due
          to space constraints in the conference center, it is necessary that we
          divide the trade show into two groups, during our two days at sea.
          Companies will be designated <strong>Group 1</strong> or
          <strong>Group 2</strong> depending on the time of registration and
          payment in full.

        <h3>Exhibitor Space</h3>
        <p>
          145 Summit at Sea exhibit space is included in your conference fee,
          limit one space per repair center. Exhibitor space is limited and will
          assigned on a first come, first served basis after verification of
          payment for the conference. Each repair center will be provided a
          confirmation code once their conference fees are paid in full. This
          confirmation code will be associated with the Exhibitor's Booth
          number, however, the confirmation code does NOT determine your booth
          space location. Once a company has completed payment for the
          conference, a timestamp will be collected. This timestamp will be used
          by SAS Coordinators to assign your group number and booth spaces.
          Booth numbers will be assigned and sent to each registered company
          several weeks prior to the conference. SAS will not entertain any
          requests for combined booths or contiguous locations for sister
          companies, affiliated companies or wholly owned subsidiaries.
          <strong
            >Your conference fee includes: 6' x 8' networking area with standard
            6' L x 24? W x 30? H table, 2 side chairs, 1 wastebasket and an ID
            sign.</strong
