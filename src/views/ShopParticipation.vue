        <p>
          An inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any place where
          people gather. COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can

          dangers arising from or relating in any way to the risk of contracting
          a communicable disease or illness-including, without limitation,
          exposure to COVID-19 or any other bacteria, virus, or other pathogen
          capable of causing a communicable disease or illness, whether that
          exposure occurs before, during, or after the event, and regardless of
          how caused or contracted-and you hereby waive any and all claims and
          potential claims against SAS-relating to such risks, hazards, and
          dangers.
        </p>

        <h3>Indemnity Clause</h3>
        <p>
          Registration for SAS is an agreement between the Attendee, the
          Attendee's organization (as identified on the registration form), and
          SAS. Each Attendee warrants that the Attendee is competent to
          represent and bind his or her organization for purposes of this
          registration. Upon full payment of the registration fees, and
          agreement to these terms, SAS shall permit the undersigned Attendee to
          attend and participate in the SAS Conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Attendee and his or her organization (together, the "Indemnifying
          Parties"), jointly and severally, release, indemnify and hold harmless
          SAS and its Board of Directors and their respective companies
          (together, the "Indemnified Parties"), from any and all losses,
          damages, injuries, liabilities and claims of any nature whatsoever,
          whether through SAS's alleged negligence or otherwise, which directly
          or indirectly occur during, or result from such person's attendance at
          or participation in, the SAS conference. The Attendee further
          understands and agrees that all property right in the material
          presented, including common law copyright, are expressly reserved to
          the presenter or speaker or to SAS. If another individual participates
          in the place of a registered attendee per the SAS transfer policy, the
          new registrant agrees to this disclaimer and waiver by default of
          transfer. This policy also applies to any registered guest attending
          the SAS on behalf of a registered attendee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Attendee and the Attendee's organization assume all risk
          associated with participation in the Conference. For purposes of this
          Agreement, the Conference includes all events sponsored by the SAS,
          including but not limited to the Hospitality Suite, consumption of
          alcohol, beverages, and meals. In the event of any legal action
          involving this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
          reimbursement of reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred.
