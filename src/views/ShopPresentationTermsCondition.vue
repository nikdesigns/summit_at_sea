          A main event of the 145 Summit at Sea are the Shop Presentation
          meetings. We've organized this event in such a way that it maximizes a
          shop's exposure to 50 airline maintenance representatives and reduces
          the number of presentations to one presentation per repair center.
          Below are the terms and conditions surrounding the event:
          <!-- <a href="#">Mattis mauris semper</a> sed amet vitae sed turpis id. -->

        <h3>Airline Participation Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          All Airline company representatives must participate in the Shop
          Presentation Sessions according to the following criteria:
        </p>
        <p>
          The Conference Center will be divided into four independent conference
          rooms, each with space for 50 airline representatives. One (1) airline
          representative from each airline should be present in each one of the
          four conference rooms. No more than one (1) airline company
          representative is permitted in any one of the four conference rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Airline Representatives are expected to be present, and seated, in
          their designated conference room ten (10) minutes prior to the start
          time.
        </p>

        <h3>Shop Priority Grouping for Shop Presentation Appointments</h3>
        <p>
          Upon Registration and payment in full, 145 Summit at Sea will log a
          timestamp and the attending company will be automatically placed into
          Presenting Group 1 or Presenting Group 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Approximately one month prior to the event, the Primary Company
          Contact will receive an email confirming the Company's group number,
          conference room number and time slot for their presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, the Company will also confirm back to 145 Summit at Sea
          the representative who will be presenting to the airlines.
        </p>

        <h3>Shop Presentation Participation Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Designated Presenters should arrive at the conference center fifteen
          (15) minutes prior to their scheduled appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only paid Conference Attendees may participate in Shop Presentation
          Sessions.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          The Committee will provide an audible tone signaling the end of each
          presentation period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please observe the five (5) minute limit by moving clear of the podium
          for the next presenter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenters are encouraged to politely remind other Presenters who may
          be occupying their respective appointment time. If there is a problem,
          contact one of The 145 Summit at Sea Assistants in the area for help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenters shall remain outside of their designated Conference Room
          Number until their scheduled appointment time.
        </p>
